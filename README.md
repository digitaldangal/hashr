An easy to use file hashing utility working with multiple algorithms. Powered by [React](https://reactjs.org/) & [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/), built as a cross-plaform desktop application using [Electron](https://electronjs.org/).

## Usage

After starting the application, drag & drop your target file to window's central area. File information will automatically be filled up.

The ```Compare to``` field is optional. On below screenshot it corresponds to a digest given by the file provider used to check file integrity.

Repeat previous click to go to the process screen. On success, generated digest will appear in the ```Hash``` field.

A comparison will be done only if the ```Compare to``` field was filled in during first step.
